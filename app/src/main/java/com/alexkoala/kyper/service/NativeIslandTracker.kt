/**
 * Tracks other apps' native islands (focus notifications, MediaStyle players) and decides for how
 * long the permanent island should yield to them.
 *
 * The permanent island must step aside when a native island appears, but only briefly: HyperOS
 * always shows the newest focus island on top, so a posted pill never blocks a fresh island. Gating
 * on the mere existence of a native notification instead suppressed the pill for as long as that
 * notification lived — a paused media player or a system roaming banner can sit for hours (#255).
 *
 * The first-seen timestamp is kept across updates on purpose: a progress-updating media
 * notification would otherwise renew its own yield window forever.
